          <h1 class="section-title">Our Vision</h1>
          <p><b>Princeton University Science Olympiad</b> is a non-profit student organization dedicated to inspiring creative problem solving, STEM literacy, and love for learning through its annual high school invitational tournament. We provide an innovative, challenging, yet representative Science Olympiad experience that gives teams of all backgrounds the best possible preparation for Regionals, States, and the National Tournament.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">What We Offer</h1>
          <p>Due to the coronavirus situation, we are planning a <b>virtual tournament</b> for early 2021. Check back for details in the future!</p>

          <p>On <b>Saturday, February 8th, 2020</b>, we hosted the third annual <b>Princeton University Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament</b> for Division C (High School). The tournament is led and organized entirely by students at Princeton who have supervised events for invitational tournaments across the country and medaled at the highest levels of competition. Our team knows how to run a fun, yet appropriately challenging Science Olympiad tournament.</p>
          <p>Key features of the tournament:</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <ul>
                <li>All 23 Division C events will run in accordance with the national Science Olympiad Inc. rules.</li>
                <li>Tests will be written and run by experienced Princeton students, many of whom have medaled at nationals or states, and/or have experience supervising events at tournaments across the country.</li>
                <li>All exams and labs undergo multiple revisions by our executive board for consistency, appropriate difficulty spread, and content relevance.</li>
                <li>No registration fees.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <ul>
                <li>The competition schedule will be based on and closely resemble that of the National Tournament to minimize event conflicts.</li>
                <li>Coaches will not be required to run any events or otherwise volunteer for the tournament, and thus will be free to watch students compete.</li>
                <li>Following the tournament, all teams will receive copies of the tests and solutions for future reference, as well as raw score statistics to gauge their level of preparation.</li>
                <li>Competitors can attend campus tours and explore Princeton's STEM offerings.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p style="padding-top:5px;">This year, we once again offer a fun and challenging invitational tournament that will provide rigorous preparation for Regionals, States, and the National Tournament. We hope to welcome you to campus this February! Visit the <a href="info.html">Tournament Information</a> section to learn more about competition policies and registration.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">History</h1>
          <p>Princeton University Science Olympiad was founded in fall 2016 by David Fan ('19) and Edison Lee ('19) with the administrative support from the <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/engineering/" target="_blank">School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> and <a href="https://ehs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Office of Environmental Health and Safety</a>. The very first Princeton University Invitational hosted 36 teams from four states on <b>February 4th, 2017</b>. In its second year, Princeton University Science Olympiad expanded the tournament to 48 teams from across the country and became the first college invitational to waive registration fees, as well as continuing to perfect all aspects of the competition experience.</p>
