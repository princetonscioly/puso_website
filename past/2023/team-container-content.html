I really enjoyed Protein Modeling and Forensics back when I was on a Science Olympiads team in high school, so I'm excited to be involved in organizing the Princeton Invitationals Competition.

                William is a math major and Science Olympiad alum from West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South. When he's not doing math or organizing tournaments, Will enjoys playing piano, reading philosophy, and figuring out how to pretend he's productive on bios when he actually just naps all the time. He's happy that last year's tournament was fun and successful!

                Eddie Lee is a senior from West Windsor-Plainsboro North majoring in Chemistry. He competed in Science Olympiad for six years and led the WW-P North team to nationals during his senior year. His extensive experience competing in ecology-related events inspired a love of plants, and he now enjoys escaping to the outdoors. After starting and co-directing Princeton's inaugural invitational, he hopes to use his experience to help the newly expanded team run its best tournament yet!
