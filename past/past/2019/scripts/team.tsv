David Fan	19	Founder, 2017 Director	David Fan is a senior from Montgomery High School majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics + Machine Learning. He competed in Science Olympiad for six lovely years, and founded NJ's first invitational tournament while in high school. He has supervised events at many tournaments, and is passionate about contributing his experiences to raise the level of Science Olympiad tournaments nationwide. In Fall 2016, David co-founded and directed the first ever Princeton University Science Olympiad Invitational along with Eddie. This year, David is excited to advise Princeton University Science Olympiad in its third year, after a tremendously successful second year. On campus, David also advises HackPrinceton, plays club table tennis, and occasionally practices his clarinet...

After starting and co-directing Princeton's inaugural invitational, he hopes to use his experience to help the newly expanded team run its best tournament yet!	
Reilly Bova	19	2018 Logistics Director	Reilly is a junior from Philadelphia, PA and a proud alumnus of the Harriton High School Science Olympiad team. Last year, Reilly served as the Logistics Director and the year prior he served as the Head Event Supervisor for Chemistry Lab. This year Reilly is taking a step back to serve in as an advisor to the logistics team and so that he can supervise Sounds of Music. Although he has no idea what he wants to do with his life, Reilly's passion for computer science has driven him to pursue a BSE COS degree, which he supplements with studies related to his other passions such as music, physics, and Latin. Outside of class, Reilly loves watching movies, conducting school ensembles, cooking great food, and — above all else — playing percussion in the fantastic Princeton University Orchestra!	
Yusha Sun	20	2018 Chemistry Director	Yusha is a junior in the Physics department. He is from College Station, TX, where he competed in Science Olympiad throughout all of high school. In 2016, he was one of the 20 USNCO study campers. Besides Science Olympiad, he enjoys playing piano, thinking of puns, and synthesizing colorful compounds.

Bill Huang	19	2018 Earth Science Director	Bill is currently a senior majoring in Mathematics, but knows a surprising amount of Earth Science. He is still salty (and probably will always be) about choking Experimental Design at states, but still has plenty of fond memories (and lots of medals) from his years of Science Olympiad with West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South. If he's running your event, chances are the test will be rather difficult, so be prepared :) In his free time, he enjoys swimming (which comes with great pregames) and playing piano, but usually ends up wasting all of it on Steam. Last year, Bill was the event supervisor for Astronomy.	
Audrey Shih	20	2018 Finance Director	Audrey is a junior from Columbus, Ohio in the CBE department. She is excited to be involved with Science Olympiad in a role that does not involve getting fingers superglued together (or worse, onto the project), and other science-y risks. In her free time, Audrey enjoys playing piano and clarinet, occasionally composing music or drawing, and questioning her major choice.
