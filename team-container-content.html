                Hi! I’m Aidan and I am a member of the Outreach Committee for the 2022 PUSO. I have been involved in Science Olympiad since 2015 when I joined my middle school team. I am also an event supervisor for Disease Detectives, my favorite Science Olympiad event and one that is quite relevant in today’s world. I am a History concentrator seeking to pursue a certificate in Linguistics and I am from Providence, Rhode Island (the capital of the best state)! In my free time, I love to bake and spend time in the outdoors. I am super excited for an engaging  and fun event! :)

                Shirley originally hails from the sunny realm of Sydney, Australia, but has since gotten stuck with the eternal winters of Upstate New York. In high school, Shirley competed with the Fayetteville-Manlius Science Olympiad team, with whom she has fond memories of 1 AM build testing, 10 person human pyramids, and smashing whipped cream in peoples' faces. When not directing Science Olympiad, you can find Shirley making bubble tea runs and nursing her perpetually sprained ankles.

                William is a math major and Science Olympiad alum from West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South. When he's not doing math or organizing tournaments, Will enjoys playing piano, reading philosophy, and figuring out how to pretend he's productive on bios when he actually just naps all the time. He's happy that last year's tournament was fun and successful!
