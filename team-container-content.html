In high school, Shirley competed with the Fayetteville-Manlius Science Olympiad team, with whom she has fond memories of 1 AM build testing, 10 person human pyramids, and smashing whipped cream in peoples' faces. When not directing Science Olympiad, you can find Shirley making bubble tea runs and nursing her perpetually sprained ankles.

When he's not doing math or organizing tournaments, Will enjoys playing piano, reading philosophy, and figuring out how to pretend he's productive on bios when he actually just naps all the time. He's happy that last year's tournament was fun and successful!
